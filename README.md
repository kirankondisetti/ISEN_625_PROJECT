Taking the work done in the above research paper into consideration, the current
projectâ€™s model is created and is simulated in python focuses on determining the capacity
for a distribution center. The process starts with the various supplying plants
scheduling production according to a monthly forecast. Once produced, the output
is dispatched by truck to the distribution center where the product will be unloaded,
placed into stock, later retrieved for the load preparation process, and placed on a
local delivery truck. Once dispatched, a truck will leave the distribution of a wide
array of products, including bottle containers of different materials. This variety contributes
to the complexity of warehouse operations since both the container material
and expiration dates must be considered. Additionally, warehouse operations restrict
the maximum stacking height due to product packaging integrity concerns, which
imposes a constraint on the storage capacity. At the same time, company policy
stipulates that products dispatched to customers must be more than 30 days away
from expiration. To avoid shortages that would result in sale losses, sufficient stock
must be kept on-hand at the warehouse to cover not only the customer demand but
also to replace the discovered aged product that cannot be dispatched to customers.
The resulting simulation model was used to perform a series of experiments based on
well-defined scenarios to evaluate the effect of facility storage capacity, and concluded
that increasing warehouse pallet storage capacity improves efficiency.
